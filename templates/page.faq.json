            "text": "SNOW⁺ operates efficiently with clumping litter. We advise using a premium, standard-weight, clay-based clumping litter. Additionally, you can use certain silica gel litter beads and crystals with SNOW⁺ as long as they can pass through the screen. Plant-based alternatives may also be compatible, but they often produce less compact clumps that might lead to moisture accumulation in the waste drawer. When opting for a plant-based litter with SNOW⁺, consider more frequent waste drawer emptying and cleaning. Litters that are not suitable for SNOW⁺ include those designed solely for absorption, non-clumping or those with loose clumping properties, newspaper-based options, and absorbent wood pellet litter.",

            "text": "We recommend having up to 4 indoor cats using a single SNOW⁺ unit; however, some of our customers have more cats and still use just one unit. Here's a general guideline: with one cat using SNOW⁺, you may need to empty the waste drawer every 2 weeks. For two cats, it might be once a week, and for three cats, twice a week, and so forth. SNOW⁺ features an expanded waste drawer for greater waste capacity, reducing the frequency of emptying. SNOW⁺ initiates a cleaning cycle 4 minutes after each use, but if another cat interrupts this period, the timer will reset for another 4 minutes, potentially leaving waste in the litter for more than 4 minutes. Having too many cats per SNOW⁺ unit may result in the litter not being completely clean for the next use.",

            "text": "Cats are naturally inquisitive and tend to explore new objects. If your cat is accustomed to a covered litter box, they might adapt more quickly to SNOW⁺. We recommend initially keeping SNOW⁺ turned off while your cat gets used to it. Place SNOW⁺ in the same spot as your old litter box. You can keep the old litter box nearby for a short period. Take a cup of litter from the old box and mix it with the clean litter in SNOW⁺. This will provide a familiar scent, encouraging your cat to investigate. Once your cat steps inside and feels the litter, they should instinctively know what to do. For further guidance on acclimating your cat (超链接到引导小猫使用专属页面）, please refer to our resources.",

            "text": "Kittens weighing 3.3 pounds or more can safely use SNOW⁺ in automatic mode. For kittens below this weight threshold, turn off automatic cleaning and opt for \"semi-automatic\" mode. To do this, deactivate automatic cleaning in the PetSnowy APP and manually initiate the cleaning process pressing the clean button or the App once or twice daily (ensure the kitten is not inside the machine when pressing the button). This approach ensures your kitten's safety during their early encounters with SNOW⁺, while also relieving you of the need to manually scoop the litter box.",
