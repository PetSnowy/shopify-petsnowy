Additionally, you can use certain silica gel litter beads and crystals with SNOW⁺ as long as they can pass through the screen. Plant-based alternatives may also be compatible, but they often produce less compact clumps that might lead to moisture accumulation in the waste drawer. When opting for a plant-based litter with SNOW⁺, consider more frequent waste drawer emptying and cleaning. Litters that are not suitable for SNOW⁺ include those designed solely for absorption, non-clumping or those with loose clumping properties, newspaper-based options, and absorbent wood pellet litter.",

Here's a general guideline: with one cat using SNOW⁺, you may need to empty the waste drawer every 2 weeks. For two cats, it might be once a week, and for three cats, twice a week, and so forth. SNOW⁺ features an expanded waste drawer for greater waste capacity, reducing the frequency of emptying. SNOW⁺ initiates a cleaning cycle 4 minutes after each use, but if another cat interrupts this period, the timer will reset for another 4 minutes, potentially leaving waste in the litter for more than 4 minutes. Having too many cats per SNOW⁺ unit may result in the litter not being completely clean for the next use.",

We recommend initially keeping SNOW⁺ turned off while your cat gets used to it. Place SNOW⁺ in the same spot as your old litter box. You can keep the old litter box nearby for a short period. Take a cup of litter from the old box and mix it with the clean litter in SNOW⁺. This will provide a familiar scent, encouraging your cat to investigate.

To do this, deactivate automatic cleaning in the PetSnowy APP and manually initiate the cleaning process pressing the clean button or the App once or twice daily (ensure the kitten is not inside the machine when pressing the button).

The globe is protected by a durable, impermeable flexible liner. If any liquid manages to reach above the halfway mark, it will simply drip or drain down to the liner and then into the litter, without collecting or pooling. This will result in a clump forming at the edge of the litter bed, which will be removed during the cleaning cycle when the globe liner peels off. If your cat consistently sprays, you may need to clean the interior of the globe more frequently to remove any residue. For a thorough cleaning, you can easily remove the entire globe. Our globe is designed with a magnetic attachment, making it a quick one-second process to take it out for cleaning.",
