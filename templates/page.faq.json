            "text": "SNOW⁺ operates efficiently with clumping litter. We advise using a premium, standard-weight, clay-based clumping litter. Additionally, you can use certain silica gel litter beads and crystals with SNOW⁺ as long as they can pass through the screen. Plant-based alternatives may also be compatible, but they often produce less compact clumps that might lead to moisture accumulation in the waste drawer. When opting for a plant-based litter with SNOW⁺, consider more frequent waste drawer emptying and cleaning. Litters that are not suitable for SNOW⁺ include those designed solely for absorption, non-clumping or those with loose clumping properties, newspaper-based options, and absorbent wood pellet litter.",
