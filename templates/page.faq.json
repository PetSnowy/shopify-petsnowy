Device performs a self-check: Turn on the device again and allow it to perform a self-check for approximately 2 minutes.<\/p><p>3. Test the weighing sensor: After the self-check, place an object weighing more than 1.5 kg on the device. Check if the cloud-shaped indicator light on the control panel changes from white to blue-green flashing alternately. If it does, it means that the device's weighing sensor is working correctly. This suggests that the device was not<br\/>able to detect the cat due to its lightweight. <\/p><p>4. Verify app settings: If the cloud light remains white and cannot recognize the weight, please check if you have enabled the automatic cleaning function in the app on your phone.

Ambient light setting and child lock: If you turned off the ambient light setting and then enabled the child lock function in the app, it may cause the device to appear as if it is not turning<br\/>on. To resolve this, you can restore the device to its factory settings. Press and hold the reset button, unplug the power cord, then plug it back in while still holding down the reset button. Release the reset button when the process is complete.<\/p><p>2. Power socket or adapter issue: Another possibility is a problem with the power socket or power adapter. Try plugging the device into a different socket and ensure that the power adapter is working properly. Use a power adapter with the same wattage as the original one. Even if you have already tried a different power adapter, it is essential to match<br\/>the wattage to the original adapter.<\/p>"

Check network, router, and frequency band: Make sure you are using a stable network connection, a reliable router,<br\/>and an appropriate frequency band for your device. Inquire about the compatibility of your device with the router and frequency band you are using.<\/p><p>2. Evaluate distance and obstacles: Consider the distance between your router and the device. If there are multiple<br\/>walls or obstacles between them, it can weaken the signal and cause frequent disconnections. Try placing the device next to the router for a day and observe if it still disconnects after a few hours. This will help determine if the issue is related to a weak signal. <\/p><p>3. Provide device ID to technicians: Our technicians require the SNOW+ device ID to access the backend data. To locate the device ID, open the litter box device, click on the \"pen\" icon in the top right corner, and select \"DEVICE INFO.\" Kindly share this ID with our support team for further assistance.<\/p>"
